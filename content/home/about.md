My name is Šime Pavlić.  

I am a dedicated Software Engineer from Croatia specializing in the realm of backend development. Experienced in Golang and Docker, my work primarily revolves around creating robust and scalable solutions. In addition, I am passionate about Computer Vision technologies and have accumulated significant experience in Python, along with familiarity with its Machine Learning frameworks such as Tensorflow, Keras, and Pytorch.

My curiosity drives me to seek new skills, knowledge, and opportunities. This approach to learning leads me to pursue challenges that push me both professionally and personally.

One of my most cherished accomplishments is successfully completing the Camino Francés, followed by the Camino Finisterre-Muxía. These endeavors tested me physically and mentally, strengthened my confidence, and enriched my understanding of other cultures and perspectives.

I believe in pushing the boundaries of technology while maintaining a connection with the natural world, and I eagerly anticipate opportunities where I can apply my skills and passions to make a meaningful impact.
