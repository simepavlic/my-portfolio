## Web Development Projects

I have designed and developed a variety of websites that helped my brother and me start a few local businesses. Here are some noteworthy examples:

- **[Uredno.eu](https://uredno.eu/)**: A dedicated platform designed to simplify the process of hiring cleaning services in Zagreb, Croatia. This site features a clean and intuitive interface that allows users to swiftly navigate and schedule services.

- **[Belcanto.hr](https://belcanto.hr/)**: This website serves as a seamless online booking platform to hire musicians for a variety of events such as weddings and funerals.

- **[Transferi.eu](https://transferi.eu/)**: A website designed for the easy booking of comfortable car transfers within Croatia.
