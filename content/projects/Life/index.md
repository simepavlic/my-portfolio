## Extracurricular Achievements & Future Goals

In addition to my professional pursuits, I have a passion for physical and mental challenges that push me beyond my limits.

### Notable Accomplishments:

- **Camino Frances + Camino Finisterre-Mux√≠a**: Successfully trekked 920 kilometers and earned several blisters along the way.

- **Medvednica 1 trail**: Hiked this challenging, 54 kilometers long route in a single day.

### Future Goals:

- **GR20**: One of Europe's most demanding long-distance trails.

- **Camino del Norte**: My next hiking goal.

- **Marathon**: I aspire to train for and complete a marathon to test my endurance and mental fortitude.

These extracurricular activities, although distinct from my professional career, underscore my resilience, determination, and continuous desire to learn and improve - traits that also serve me well in my professional endeavors.
